# 🏋️ Tech Stack
I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React for this project. 

# 🧑‍🔬 In the Future
- CSS-in-JS: The codebase is a little difficult to read, but I did write this a couple months ago, and I'm a much different coder now. 
- Theme: I'm also going to experiment with a light-mode dark-mode theme for better accessibility.
- Projects: I made some more projects! I'll update the projects tab when I make a new website.
- GatsbyJS: I'm going to experiment with the GatsbyJS framework for static-site rendering. In the past, I had issues with the website loading extremely slowly.
